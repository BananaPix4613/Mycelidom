Mycelidom is a hobby video game development project that a handful of people have decided to work on. The game itself is a 3/4 top-down perspective action-adventure metroidvania that takes place on a miniture scale in the wilderness. The player plays as the mushling, who is a sentient mushroom, with the ability to absorb the spores and therefore abilities of other mushrooms. Throughout a player's experience of the game we intend to provide them with a vast world with which to discover unqiue abilities and the interactions between them as well as a massive roster of various insects, arthropods, crustaceons, rodents and bosses for the player to face off against as they discover the secrets of this world.
